"""mirrorthird — mirrorseat with our seven's share lowered from 1/2 to 1/3 against nartaa's CoAtNet alone.

Same seven, same foreign seat, same serving as `kneemri-mirrorseat` (0.953, ref 57008651); only the final
share moves. The downward half of the bracket around 1/2 (`kneemri-mirrortwo` is the upward half). nartaa
is the stronger solo on the board (0.949 vs ours7 0.945), which is the argument for leaning on it.

PRE-REGISTRATION (mirrorseat 0.953, board resolution 0.001, top-band residual sd ~0.002):
- **>= 0.954** — the stronger solo deserves the larger share; the next point is 1/4.
- **0.952-0.953** — flat around 1/2; the share is not a lever at board resolution. Keep mirrorseat.
- **<= 0.951** — ours is carrying the blend; the optimum is at or above 1/2.

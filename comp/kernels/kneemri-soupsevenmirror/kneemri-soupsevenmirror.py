"""soupsevenmirror — mirrorthird with the soup ADDED beside the seven on the ours side, not swapped in.

nartaa 384 at 2/3 as in `kneemri-mirrorthird` (0.953); the ours third is split evenly between the seven
(LogitAverage, board 0.944 alone) and `basinsoup_ff_k4_s2026` (board 0.946 alone), each at 1/6, in rank
space in one `RaptorSeat.combined` call. Offline fold-0 analog (basinsoup_k4 + ours6, nartaa replicas
a/c, n=896): +0.0010 [+0.0003, +0.0017] over ours6 alone as the partner, P>0 1.00 on both replicas —
tighter than the soup alone (+0.0011 [-0.0002, +0.0025]), because it keeps the seven's diversity.

PRE-REGISTRATION (mirrorthird 0.953, board resolution 0.001, top-band residual sd ~0.002):
- **>= 0.954** — the soup's edge carries into the blend; this becomes the ours side for picks.
- **0.952-0.953** — under the board's resolution; keep mirrorthird.
- **<= 0.951** — the offline analog does not transfer; the ours side is closed at the seven.

"""s6r7pftrio40 — `kneemri-s6r7pfheavytrio` with the reader half split 0.60 R7 / 0.40 nartaa instead of 0.50 / 0.50.

Everything else is pfheavytrio's (57431093, 0.958, manual pick): soups and mirrorthird's seven at 1/12 each, R6 bundle
`fe055406` with flip TTA, nartaa 384 / 224 at 0.65 / 0.35, no share table. Carries nartaa40 (the flat line at 0.40) onto
the pick-2 structure. Read by the TEAM ROW:
- **row moves up** — the split optimum is below 0.50 on the trio line too; Kaggle's auto pick moves here.
- **row holds** — the split peaks at 0.50-0.60; picks unchanged.

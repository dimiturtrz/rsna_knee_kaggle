"""Submission from ONE model: the single strongest member, with no ensembling at all.

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS. Every entry so far has been a rank-average of several members, and fold and
seed ensembling are now out on purpose: they buy variance reduction rather than signal, and each
member costs a full run on 80% of the corpus. What nobody here has measured is the PRICE of dropping
them - if one model loses little, the whole ensembling apparatus can go and the GPU it consumes moves
to mechanisms. `strongest(1)` picks by recorded holdout, which is fold 2 at 0.8518.

Read it against the three-member entry pushed alongside it: same members, same reading, same kit, so
the only difference is how many models vote.


Our weights, our data layer, our submission path. The members were fitted by `kneemri.train` on the
report-derived labels, selected on a holdout split by REPORT-TEXT HASH so the template reports that
recur across studies cannot straddle the divide.

The same fingerprint check guards these members as guards the published ones: a member run under a
different reading than it was fitted under loads cleanly and predicts from the wrong image, and nothing
else in the run would say so.

Everything below the bootstrap lives in `kneemri.kernel_run`, shared with the efficiency kernel. Only
the bootstrap — finding the mounted kit and installing its wheels — has to be here, because it runs
BEFORE the package it is finding can be imported.

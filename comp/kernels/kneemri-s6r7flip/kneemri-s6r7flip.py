"""s6r7flip — `kneemri-s6r7solo` with heliosli's R7 reader scored WITH its own mirror TTA, nothing else moved.

The R7 bundle (`heliosli/rsna-knee-compact-r7cnxfsss`, bundle 8c7b666e27dc0e8f) was trained with `mirror: 0.5` — half of
every training batch was the virtual contralateral knee (coronal/axial width flip, sagittal slice reversal, Medial <->
Lateral outputs permuted) — and its worker ships `--flip-tta`, which scores the same transform at inference and averages
the two passes in logit space (MCL from the plain pass). The manifest leaves it off (`flip_tta: false`), so every public
R7 blend, ours included, reads the reader on one of the two views it was trained on. One anchor in the source flips it.
Runtime: on the sample R7 is loader-bound (decode ~40 s vs gpu ~5.5 s a study), so the doubled forward should hide
under the decode; studies the 8.3 h deadline does not reach fall back to the mean score, which `run_check` cannot see.
PRE-REG (B = `s6r7solo_v1` 0.957, resolution 0.001, top-band residual sd 0.0013 @ledger75):
- **> B** — the second view carries signal the plain pass misses; becomes pick 1 and the pin.
- **= B** — mirror TTA at a third of the rank vote is below board resolution; s6r7solo stays.
- **< B** — the mirrored pass, or its state read-out through a stacker fitted on plain passes, costs signal (or the
  deadline bit); s6r7solo stays.

# experiments — the arms, in git, runnable by shell

Every number this project reports came out of one of these. They lived in `/tmp` until 2026-08-11,
which meant the definition of each measurement was unversioned, unreviewable, and one reboot from
gone — the same failure the no-notebooks rule exists to prevent. An arm is code. It belongs here.

```bash
bash experiments/arms/compose_base.sh            # one arm, foreground
nohup bash experiments/arms/whole_stack.sh &     # one arm, detached
```

Each arm sources `lib.sh`, which resolves the data root through `core.paths` (never a hardcoded
`D:/data`), fails on a missing input **before** spending GPU, and tees full output to
`<processed>/experiments/<arm>.full.log`. Logs are data and stay out of the repo; arms are code and
stay in it.

An arm file carries its hypothesis, its control number, and its result in the header. Reading the
directory is meant to be the same as reading the ledger.

## Two rules encoded in `lib.sh` rather than remembered

- **`wait_for` keys on a completion marker.** A gate that watches an output path fires when the
  producer *starts*. That once queued an arm against a 59.7 GB cache still mostly zeros; it would not
  have crashed, it would have produced a plausible wrong number.
- **`run_train` tees before it greps.** Arms used to pipe straight into `grep`, so any traceback whose
  wording missed the filter vanished and the run looked merely empty.

## Ledger — fold 0, seed 2026, 24 epochs, one-cycle, weight floor, ranking on

Control for the small arms is `rank24_s2026` = **0.8272**; for base arms, `rankbase24_s2026` = **0.8283**.
The noise floor on this ruler is **0.0062**, and this project's bar for a *result* is ~1.5% absolute —
so everything below is **directional**, and only the cumulative total clears the bar.

| arm | change | score | Δ | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rate_isolate` | encoder rate 8e-6 → 4e-5, depth 6 | 0.8323 | +0.0051 | kept, single-variable |
| — | same rate at depth 12 | 0.8316 | +0.0044 | depth is not a lever |
| `slice_count_maxpool` Q | max slice pooling, 12 slices | 0.8310 | +0.0038 | kept |
| `slice_count_maxpool` R | max pooling, 20 slices | 0.8309 | −0.0001 vs Q | **refuted** |
| `severity_flat` | three YES levels collapsed to one | 0.8228 | −0.0044 | gradation is live signal |
| `report_supervision` | report-embedding term @0.3 | 0.8219 | −0.0053 | **refuted** |
| `report_supervision` | report-embedding term @1.0 | 0.8209 | −0.0063 | refuted, monotone |
| `compose_base` | rate + pooling on base | **lost at epoch 7/24** | — | not rerun |
| **`whole_stack`** | **all 12 slices per step, 12 epochs** | **0.8457** | **+0.0147** | **largest change measured** |
| `wholestack_folds` 1 | same recipe, fold 1 | **0.8505** | — | ensemble member |
| **`resolution`** | **336 → 392 px, read from the 448 cache** | **0.8523** | **+0.0066** | **clears the floor** |
| `slice_attention` | attention over slices, not max | queued | — | guard fixed, was refusing 'attend' |
| `wholestack_folds` 2 | same recipe, fold 2 | **0.8518** | — | best single member; epoch-5 partial |
| `slices16_ws` | 16 cached slices, whole-stack | 0.8452 | −0.0005 | **refuted**, 33% slower for nothing |
| `extended_slots` | nine slots, +1,139 coronal series | queued | — | aimed at MCL |

## The running total, which is the number the bar applies to

Individual arms keep landing inside the noise floor, and that is the wrong frame to judge them by: the
rule is to track the cumulative total against the ORIGINAL baseline, because increments below the bar
still compose.

| | holdout | step | total vs baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rank24_s2026` — the control every early arm was read against | 0.8272 | — | — |
| whole-stack reading | 0.8457 | +0.0185 | **+0.0185** |
| + 392 px, read from the 448 cache | **0.8523** | +0.0066 | **+0.0251** |

Both peak at epoch 6. 392 px is the last rung that fits: patch-14 needs multiples of 14, so the ladder
is 336 (576 tokens) → 392 (784) → 420 (900) → 448 (1024), and 392 already holds 28.4 GB of a 32 GB card
while 448 OOMed outright. Buying the next rung would mean a smaller batch, which changes the ranking
term's within-batch pair count and stops it being one variable.

**+0.0251 clears the 1.5% bar**, against a floor of 0.0053. No single arm did — whole-stack came
closest at +0.0185 on its own control. Two things this does NOT license: reading the total as evidence
for any individual knob inside it, and expecting it on the leaderboard, where our holdout gains have so
far transferred at roughly half (`knee-lv2`).

## Ensemble SIZE is worth more than anything we can do to a single model

| members | holdout per member | public LB |
|---|---|---|
| our strongest model ever | 1 | 0.8518 | 0.868 |
| whole-stack | 2 | 0.8481 | 0.882 |
| whole-stack | 3 | 0.8493 | 0.882 |
| ours, old channel-stacked windowed recipe | 5 | 0.8269 | 0.888 |
| the published CC0 members | 20 | 0.8398 | 0.888 |
| **ours 3 + the published 20** | **23** | mixed | **0.894** |
| 2 — whole-stack | 0.8481 | **0.882** |
| 5 — old, channel-stacked, windowed | 0.8269 | **0.888** |

Six entries built to isolate one variable. The best single model this project has produced loses to
five much weaker ones by **0.020** — more than whole-stack (+0.0147) and more than every knob combined.

**And DIVERSITY beats more of the same.** A third member of our own recipe bought nothing (0.882 →
0.882), while adding our three to the twenty published ones — a different recipe, not a different draw
of ours — bought **+0.006 over either component alone**. Members that fail the same way do not help
each other. That is the mechanism worth building on, and it is neither folds nor seeds.

This does NOT defend folds or seeds, which remain banned and rightly so: the noise floor is the
holdout's own sampling error (`knee-2rx`), so re-running a recipe cannot buy a better measurement. It
says that AVERAGING MANY PREDICTORS is worth ~0.02, whatever produced them. So the members have to
differ by MECHANISM rather than by RNG — and every arm here is fitted on the same fold-0 split, which
makes every arm a member as well as a verdict. See `knee-9pl`.

## The leaderboard disagreed with the holdout, and that is the finding of the night

| entry | members | holdout mean | public LB |
|---|---|---|---|
| ours v2 | 5 (channel-stacked, windowed) | 0.8269 | **0.888** |
| whole-stack | 2 (fold 0 + fold 1) | 0.8481 | **0.882** |

Two members that are **+0.021 better each** scored **0.006 lower**. The prediction written before that
submission — "my honest expectation is an improvement on 0.888" — is refuted.

It is NOT evidence against whole-stack, which is +0.0147 on a matched holdout comparison measured on
two folds. It is evidence that member QUALITY alone does not carry this leaderboard, and that our
holdout gains are not transferring one-for-one. 0.006 is also small enough to be LB noise on a public
subset, so the honest reading needs the rest of the curve — 1, 3 and 23 members are in flight on
nearly the same members. See `knee-lv2`.

## Whole-stack is the result of the day

Reading every cached slice per step instead of one random three-slice window, against arm Q (identical
recipe, windowed, best of 24 epochs) = 0.8310:

| | holdout | note |
|---|---|---|
| whole-stack, 24 epochs | 0.8413 | peaked epoch 6, then declined |
| **whole-stack, 12 epochs** | **0.8457** | peaked epoch 6 — *higher* AND half the wall-clock |
| whole-stack, fold 1 | **0.8505** | second fold, same recipe |
| the five members behind our 0.888 LB | 0.8269 | mean of `member_fold0..4` |

**The shorter budget scored higher, not merely cheaper.** One-cycle is defined over `total_steps`, so a
24-epoch budget stretches the anneal across epochs the model does not need and leaves the rate far from
annealed where the model actually converges. An oversized epoch budget detunes the schedule; it is not
just wasted GPU. Both folds peaked at epoch 6, so the arms now run **8**.

It is also a replication rather than an invention: MRNet combines per-slice features by an elementwise
max over ALL slices of a series. Our three-slice window was the deviation.

## The biggest lever is not architecture

The metric is the **unweighted** mean of twelve AUCs, and our labels are far from level — MCL 0.755 and
Fracture 0.784 against Baker's 0.896. Lifting those two to 0.873, a level five other labels already
reach, is worth **+0.0173** on the mean: larger than whole-stack, and above the 1.5% bar.

Rarity and label noise were both tested and refuted as explanations: Synovitis has *fewer* positives
than MCL (580 vs 767) and the corpus's *lowest* reader confidence (0.189), and scores 0.873. So MCL is
hard to **see** — a thin ligament at the medial margin — which is what the resolution arm now targets.

## Three arms were lost on 2026-08-11, and only one cause is known

Recorded here because the ledger must not read as if the empty cells were merely pending.

- **`compose_base`** died at epoch 7 of 24 **and printed its own completion marker**, so the queue
  advanced on a corpse. Cause unrecoverable: it ran from a pre-`experiments/` script that piped into
  `grep` with no `tee`, and the traceback went with it.
- **The 448 px cache build** was killed at 2,200 of 4,407 with a log that simply stops — no traceback,
  and it was a plain redirect, so the OS killed it. RAM pressure from a 63.7 GB memmap beside a 27 GB
  trainer is suspected and **unproven**; there is no OOM event in the system log.
- **`whole_stack`** died with `unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote`. A sweep editing every
  arm's trailing marker rewrote the file **while bash was executing it** — bash reads a script
  incrementally by byte offset, so it resumed at a stale offset and died.

The plumbing changes that came out of it (`PIPESTATUS`, success-only markers that also require a
`best holdout` line, verdicts teed into the arm's own log, `run_snapshot`, `wait_for_cache` keyed on
the mask) are in `lib.sh`, each documented at the point it prevents. See `knee-7gr`.

`compose_small` was **dropped from the queue unrun**: an hour of GPU to confirm that two sub-bar
levers add cannot change any decision.

## Why the arms above mostly could not have mattered

Every row that moved less than 0.006 is a knob *inside* one design, and that design uses about a tenth
of the data it is handed — 18 of ~180 acquired slices per step, 12 cached of a median 30 per series,
17.4% of series never routed to a slot at all, 336 px for findings a few voxels wide. We are at 0.888
on the leaderboard against a 0.942 frontier, and a knob inside a family returns ~0.005 by
construction. `whole_stack` and `resolution` are the first two arms that leave it. See `knee-jk3`.

Interpretation of the whole ledger, including what each refutation rules out, lives in
`interpretations/kneemri/`. The build log is git history.
